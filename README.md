# gesture-classification
Electromyography (EMG) is the study of electrical signals released during muscle activity, and can be measured through electrodes attached to the skin. The correlation between the muscle activity and its produced signals is studied in the field of Prosthetics with the help of statistical models. These models are able to determine the gestures that produce the signals input into them. Random Forest algorithm can be used to classify the gestures based on the input signals. This project tunes hyperparameters of a Random Forest model in order to provide reasonable accuracy without overfitting the model.

This project is done in Python, utilizing the scikit-learn library.
